# MagicBox
My little Teensy project

Bought a [Teensy 3.2](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html) and placed it in a box with some buttons, switches and potentiometers.

I will update this Readme with more info about the build later.

The code for the Teensy is in the MagicBox folder and the python script it communicates with is MagicBox.py
